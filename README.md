# Shopify-Keyword-Finder

A simple script to retreive a keyword from the user, and find it on the given shopify site a user requests. If the keyword is found, it will get the stock as well as the direct add to cart link for each given size as long as the stock is greater than 0. 

## Instructions

Simply put the site name you want to search, then put the keywords when prompted, it will search the sites and return ATC links for those in stock.

I am currently working on updating it to work with multiple keywords.
